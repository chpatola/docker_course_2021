In order to get all buttons of the app to function, I did this:

0. Started the app version from exercise 2.8 and looked at the information in the browser's developer tool's network tab.
   I saw that the 2.8 button - that worked - sent requests to another backend url than the buttons that did not work
1. Change REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL in frontend docker file to http://localhost/api 
2. Build the frontend again
3. Create a new docker-compose.yaml based on the ones used for exercises 2.8 and 2.9 + substitute front2 image for front3
